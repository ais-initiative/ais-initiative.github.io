The extremely rapid development of Artificial Intelligence in recent months is both astonishing and concerning. It seems important to regulate this field to avoid potential abuses. But what exactly should be regulated? While almost everyone agrees on the need to strengthen the regulation of applications that incorporate AI techniques, the regulation of foundational models (particularly large language models) remains much more debated. These models are not applications per se; they are complex but can lead to a wide variety of services in different fields (law, healthcare, education, etc.). Should they be regulated? If so, which aspects of these models should be regulated? Or should all legislation focus on the applications, leaving the models without specific rules? More broadly, could regulation risk stifling innovation, as is often claimed?
