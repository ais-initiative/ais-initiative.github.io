## Introduction
The AI & Society initiative involves several actions aiming at watching and analysing AI’s impact on society. Our approach is resolutely interdisciplinary, combining experts from fields as AI or SSH (Social Sciences and Humanities), among many others. Our different actions are conducted independently and involve different people depending on context, interests and skills.

## Workshops
The AISI workshops study the ethical challenges stemming from the deployment of AI systems within concrete, professional or public frameworks. Initially, these workshops have been organized within 3IA Institute PRAIRIE, but they are also open to specialists outside PRAIRIE who are interested in these questions.

Three workshops have been organized between March and July 2021. The first one was an informal meeting, allowing participants to share their respective backgrounds and expectations from the group. Two thematic meetings have been organised since, about:
* [Automated decision making](ws-decision)
* [Language models](ws-language-models)

Meetings will resume in January 2022.

## Abeona Chair
This chair, created three years ago, invites a professor to conduct research on ethical questions raised by AI implementations. The chair is hosted by Ecole Normale Supérieure.

The chair is currently held by [Karine Gentelet](https://observatoire-ia.ulaval.ca/en/karine-gentelet-new-holder-of-the-abeona-ens-obvia-chair-ai-and-social-justice/) (Université Laval, Canada) for her project “Social justice and artificial intelligence: citizen governance to reverse invisibility in algorithms and discrimination in their uses”. The chair was previously held by [Kate Crawford](https://www.ens.psl.eu/en/node/5013) (2019-2020).

## Course: PSL intensive week
A course on “Ethics and Artificial Intelligence” is organised, as part of “PSL Intensive Week”, from the 22nd to the 26th November, 2021. (Pedagogical team: François Goulette, Aïda Elamrani, Thierry Poibeau, Olivia Tambou). With an audience consisting mainly of computer scientists, the aim is to raise their awareness of:
* Profound transformations underway with the digital revolution
* Existing legal and regulatory frameworks and how to comply with them;
* Open ethical questions, and ethical reflection for upcoming questions. 

In 2021, the “Ethics and AI” course is primarily open to M2 IASD students, as well as students from PSL establishments who can prove an adequate level of training, within the limit of available seats. More information [here](https://www.pslweek.fr/index.php?course=644).

## About
The AISI is coordinated by Aïda Elamrani and Thierry Poibeau.

Aïda Elamrani is currently a PhD student at Institut Jean Nicod and research engineer at the Lattice laboratory. Her research addresses philosophy of AI.

Thierry Poibeau is a research director at CNRS. He is a member of the Lattice laboratory and chair within 3IA Institute Prairie. His research addresses automated natural language processing, digital humanities and questions related to the deployment of artificial intelligence (ethical questions, impact on work, etc.).
