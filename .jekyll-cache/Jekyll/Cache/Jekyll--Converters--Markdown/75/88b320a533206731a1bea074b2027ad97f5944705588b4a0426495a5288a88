<p>In automatic language processing, a language model is a statistical model which models the distribution of sequences of words, and more generally sequences of discrete symbols (letters, phonemes, words), in a natural language. A language model can, for example, predict the word following a sequence of words. BERT and GPT-3 are language models (Translated from the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod%C3%A8le_de_langage">French Wikipedia definition</a>)</p>

<p>These models, now ubiquitous in Natural Language Processing, pose several problems: they include many biases (representation biases linked to gender, age or origin, for example), they require large amounts of data, and are therefore only available in a few languages. Finally, they require heavy training, and have therefore a very high environmental cost.</p>
