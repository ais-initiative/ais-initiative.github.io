## PSL Intensive Weeks

A course on “Ethics and Artificial Intelligence” is organised, as part of “PSL Intensive Week”, from the 22nd to the 26th November, 2021. (Pedagogical team: François Goulette, Aïda Elamrani, Thierry Poibeau, Olivia Tambou). With an audience consisting mainly of computer scientists, the aim is to raise their awareness of:
* Profound transformations underway with the digital revolution
* Existing legal and regulatory frameworks and how to comply with them;
* Open ethical questions, and ethical reflection for upcoming questions.

In 2021, the “Ethics and AI” course is primarily open to M2 IASD students, as well as students from PSL establishments who can prove an adequate level of training, within the limit of available seats. [More information here.](https://www.pslweek.fr/index.php?course=644).
